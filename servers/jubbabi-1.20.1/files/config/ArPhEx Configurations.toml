	#This controls whether the dweller bosses (spider moth, scorpioid bloodluster, draconic voidlasher, tormentor) are included in general. Set to false if you only want the other mobs, and the dwellers will become unable to be spawned in any way.
	"Boss Inclusion" = true
	#Dwellers and variant spawns are rare by default. 1=twice as common. 2=default rarity. 3=twice as rare. 4=three times rarer. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.

	"Boss Natural Spawning" = true
	#Controls the spawnrate of ALL non-boss mobs in this mod, including minibosses and all regular arthropods. Default multiplier value is 8. To double ArPhEx spawnrates, set it to 4. Lower values = more spawns (minimum value is 1). No maximum rarity. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.

	#ArPhEx has an additional spawning system that gives a 1 in (20) chance to spawn a random ArPhEx mob every time any arthropod spawns in an open area away from the player. This system still accounts for mob rarity. Default number is 20, meaning it attempts this every 1 in 20 arthropod spawns. Setting it to a number less than 1 disables the additional spawning system. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.

[Difficulty]
	#By default, the dweller bosses have hundreds of health points. Choose true to decrease their maximum to just 60 health.
	"Dweller Easy Mode" = false
	#Controls difficulty for ALL ArPhEx mobs, minibosses, and bosses. Affects their ranged projectiles too. Default value is 0. Positive values will give that level of strength. Negative values will give that equivalent level of weakness. E.g. To give all ArPhEx mobs permanent strength 5 (extreme difficulty!), set the value to 6, or for weakness 5, set it to -6. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.
